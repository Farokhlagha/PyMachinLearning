# PyML47_Perceptron
This program uses pandas, numpy, sklearn and matplotlib libraries.

## 1- Surgical üè®
Fit an object oriented perceptron algorithm on the surgical dataset for classification

[Dataset Surgical binary classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omnamahshivai/surgical-dataset-binary-classification)

Split data to train and test datasets

Implement the perceptron algorithm as a class

Fit your model on the employee's salary dataset

Plot data graph and loss graph as 2 subplots in 1 window

Change hyperparameters for get best result

## 2- Abalone dataset
Fit your perceptron algorithm on the abalone dataset

Plot data graph and loss graph as 2 subplots in 1 window

Change hyperparameters for get best result
