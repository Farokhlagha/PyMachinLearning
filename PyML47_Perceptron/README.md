# PyML47_Perceptron
This program uses pandas, numpy, sklearn and matplotlib libraries.

## 1- Surgical üè®
Fit an object oriented perceptron algorithm on the surgical dataset for classification

[Dataset Surgical binary classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omnamahshivai/surgical-dataset-binary-classification)

Plot accuracy in each epoch for train and test data

Plot loss in each epoch for train and test data

Calculate confusion matrix

Repeat the above steps with 5 different activation functions, e.g. sigmoid, tanh, relu, linear, etc.

## 2- Weather Prediction
The weather of a particular city is recorded once an hour during different years. Therefore, weather information has been recorded 24 times per day.

Draw the output table on the graph.

Then train a linear model on the above data using the perceptron algorithm.

Implement the evaluate function.

Write a predict function that can predict the air temperature by taking the day number (the number of days of the year).

Draw the following diagrams in the training process. Save the weights (W) and bias (b) in a file with npy extension.
