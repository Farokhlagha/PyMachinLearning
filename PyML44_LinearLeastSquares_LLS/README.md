# PyML44_LinearLeastSquares_LLS
This program uses pandas, numpy, sklearn and matplotlib libraries.

## 1- Students Performance (Regression)
[Machine Learning - Linear Regression](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ml_linear_regression.asp)

Generate continuous random dataset for the problem of X = study hours and Y = grade of students (if you study more, you will get a higher grade).

Split your dataset to train and test with train_test_split function.

Draw some wrong red lines with a random slope.

Draw the correct blue line using your Object Oriented Linear Least Squares (LLS) method.
