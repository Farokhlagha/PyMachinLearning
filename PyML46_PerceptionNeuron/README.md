# PyML46_PerceptionNeuron
This program uses pandas, numpy, sklearn and matplotlib libraries.

## 1- Employee Salary
[Generating simulated dataset for regression problems - GaussianWaves](https://www.gaussianwaves.com/2020/01/generating-simulated-dataset-for-regression-problems-sklearn-make_regression/)

Split data to train and test datasets

Implement the perceptron algorithm as a class

Fit your model on the employee's salary dataset

Plot data graph and loss graph as 2 subplots in 1 window

Change hyperparameters for get best result

## 2- Abalone dataset
Fit your perceptron algorithm on the abalone dataset

Plot data graph and loss graph as 2 subplots in 1 window

Change hyperparameters for get best result
